#DESCRIPTION

We've all been there, managing multiple environments that all have different SLA's and release schedules. With systems, managing configuration files can be automated with something like Chef or Puppet. With code deployment, tools can easily push out the latest release. Databases present a unique challenge where you can't just push out a current state.  You have to identify and walk through every change that has been applied and likely have to install the changes in the same order throughout environments.  In this presentation CJ is going to go over the tool that was developed in-house to address the complexity of database deployments.  CoverMyMeds has open sourced this tool at github.com/covermymeds/dbdeployer.  The tool is extensible and currently supports PostgreSQL and MSSQL.
